            <p><span lang="pt">Sebastião, Sebastião</span>,<br>
            ghost of nation's hope and pride,<br>
            I write to you on behalf of our shameful country.</p>
            <p>Did the Spaniards make us so miserable,<br>
            were we doomed ever since since <span lang="pt">Afonso</span> hit his mother?</p>
            <p>I beg of you, come save us<br>
            before the land is flooded and the cities crumble under the waves...</p>
            <p>I beg and keep begging, because God has left us and we didn't get the memo.</p>
            <p>Yet despite all my begging,<br>
            you won't come riding on your steed,<br>
            because you're nothing but mist,<br>
            a burning ache in my heart,<br>
            and only historians remember you.</p>
            <p>The cold approaches with people outside, and we hide them under tourist traps.</p>
