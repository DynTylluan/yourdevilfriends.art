        <h1>The year was 2007...</h1>
        <p>At 9 years old, I was allowed on the Internet for the very first time. I had used computers before, even seen a few websites back in 2002, but it was the first time I was allowed a Neopets account, an email, or even to be able to look things up on Google by myself.</p>
        <p>At that time the Web was wild, unregulated, like a jungle meant for you to explore- for better or for worse. I ended up finding fansites such as <a href="https://www.dragonflycave.com/" target="_blank">The Cave of Dragonflies</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071006161833/suta-raito.com/" target="_blank">Suta-Raito</a> (RIP) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120507105220/http://www.arkeis.com/" target="_blank">Arkeis</a> (RIP). I saw them and desperately wished to one day make my own. However, I didn't know where to learn or even what to look up, since my English was severely limited at the time. Instead, I drew fantasy sites on paper, creating my own pretend-Internet.</p>
        <p>Years passed, and with the rise of social media I came to forget what the Web used to be like and about that wish.</p>
        <p>That was until late 2019, back when the COVID-19 pandemic started. I bought <em><a href="https://www.hypnospace.net/" target="_blank">Hypnospace Outlaw</a></em>, a game where you explore a fantasy Internet during the 90s. The game, filled with personal websites that never actually existed, made me remember an older Internet. It made me remember that jungle.</p>
        <p>At the ripe old age of 21, I taught myself basic HTML and CSS, and the rest is history.</p>
