        <h1>AI, friend or foe?</h1>
        <p><em>Façade</em> is a 2005 video game where you are invited to the apartment of Trip and Grace, a married couple that happen to be your friends. This gathering quickly devolves into a dramatic confrontation between wife and husband, and as their friend you can support them or drive them further apart (or get kicked out of the apartment, that also is an option).</p>
        <p>What made this game unique compared to most interactive stories is that the player could type their own sentences and the characters would respond based on what was said and the context it was said in using artificial intelligence. For example, «I love your decorations» might be seen as a nice statement in a context and  condescending in another. However, the AI at the time was severely limited at the time, resulting in some legitimately bizarre interactions.</p>
        <p>AI has evolved drastically in the past few decades. For some, this is an amazing development. For others, this is a cause for concern- for images to be created by an AI, images must be fed into it... lots of which were shamelessly taken from barely-known artists. I can sympathize with online artists whose art was fed into an AI, don't get me wrong. However, will AI truly be the death of art?</p>
        <p>I'd argue it will definitely change the landscape of artistic circles (especially online), but the actual answer to that is something only the future can tell. One thing is for certain though: AI is here to stay, whether we like it or not.</p>
        <p>All we can to is prepare ourselves for the future.</p>
        <h2>Demystifying AI</h2>
        <p>Artifical intelligence, and technology in general, is merely a tool for humans to use how they see fit.</p>
        <p>The reason why AI art is seen in such a negative light is because most of it is nothing more than a cheap recreation of something that already exists- one so cheap, in fact, that it removes all value from it.</p>
        <p>Think about it: painters who forge masterpieces can be so skilled that even the snobbiest of art collectors won't mind taking a replica for their home. Behold the AI-generated images below (click to enlarge) and notice how generic they look, despite looking somewhat appealing (some of them even got the hands right).</p>

        <p>See, the problem isn't AI itself. The problem is that the people who use it see it as a collection of prompts rather than a process. Painters who create original works and painters who forge have both gone through their artistic journeys, and that is something most people who create AI-generated images simply don't seem to get.</p>
        <h2>The artistic process of a machine</h2>
        <p>My father, a former visual designer, along with a few of his friends, who are accomplished visual artists in our country, make AI-generated art for fun in their spare time. Their AI works were unlike anything else I'd ever seen- dreamlike landscapes in the style of traditional Japanese paintings, spaceships in a classical Romantic art style with impossible shapes flying above an alien planet- and they really opened up my mind to what AI is capable of.</p>
        <p>I asked my father how he achieved such unique results once. He detailed his workflow as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Defining the main shapes/figures. He called it a «sketch» (for lack of a better word)- an overall plan for the finished image.</li>
            <li>Start developing the setting and placing the figures.</li>
            <li>Start defining the colors</li>
            <li>Finally, define a style using generic terms.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Sometimes, my dad would spend a considerable amount of time on a single image, just putting things in the right place and creating the perfect atmosphere. The key is the want to create something <em>new</em>.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, my dad doesn't enjoy creating those images as much nowadays because so many people in the AI community were pestering him by asking for prompt words. They didn't understand that there was a lot of creative thinking involved in the creation of those images.</p>
        <p>It's also important to acknowledge that AI would make it easier for disabled people to create images and even large bodies of text, allowing them to express themselves creatively without the need for expensive procedures (if any are even available). The ability to think outside of the box so you can create something new is in itself an aspect of art, I'd argue it's even more valuable than artistic skill.</p>
        <h2>Learn to innovate</h2>
        <p>In <em>Façade</em>, most players enjoyed the game by saying strange or offensive things to the characters, some even trying to get the best ending possible by doing so. By not using the game's mechanics as they were intended, they had a lot more fun. That game used AI as a tool in a new and interesting way, and the players messed around with it to create funny scenarios the developers didn't have in mind.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately the AI-obsessed Silicon Valley fellows are too focused on reducing costs by imitating an artist's work instead of commissioning them, and the people up top are elderly farts who don't get how fast technology is advancing and therefore don't care for regulating its use.</p>
        <p>Creative types can change that though, if only by reinventing the purpose of this tool.</p>
