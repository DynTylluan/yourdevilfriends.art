            <h1><em>Fear and Hunger</em> log</h1>
            <!--Preamble-->
            <p>Before ever playing <em>Fear and Hunger</em>, we were introduced to the series by a video essay on the first game. Initially, we thought we would refrain from playing such a difficult game- while we're not ones to get mad at video games, we also don't like losing- and yet something about it stuck with us. Before ever having had the chance to play it we were plagued with dreams where we would explore its world... Without even coming into direct contact with it, the series had quickly become a bit of an obsession.</p>
            <p>After some weeks of deliberation, we ended up buying both games on June 24th, 2023. To our surprise, the exceedingly hard and unfair nature of the game did not deter us from enjoying the experience.</p>
            <p>We decided to detail our adventures here.</p>

                <p>We explored the woods quite thoroughly, losing an arm early to the woodsman but winning right afterwards. In Prehevil, defeated a villager and lost to the vile right afterwards.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>Died in the non-abridged introduction. Not counting this one as a proper run, but it <em>is</em> funny.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>After playing through the introduction, headed north towards the old town of Prehevil. Fought multiple enemies there, managing to win every battle but getting an infection in the last one. Entered the mayor's manor, and after exploring a bit rested on the bed. While resting, we were attacked by the decrepit priest, losing the battle to his coin toss grab. Lost the run by dying from the infection we couldn't heal.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>The one where we explored the most. Lost an arm early on to a guard, but managed to defeat most enemies we encountered, free the girl (who quickly lost her life to a guard) and go to the backyard. Learned many spells and how to dash. Got to the caverns, where we couldn't add Moonless to the party and finally lost to the cavemother. It was a bit of a bummer to lose on a run that was going well, but since we found a lot of books we got some tasty lore.</p>

                    <li>Additional thoughts: Wasting a bear trap on an easy enemy is a terrible idea</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The layout of the dungeon was the same as the last run, so we proceeded much in the same way. In the prison, fought and won against a ghoul, using a soul stone on it. Used a bear trap on Trotur in the basement, making the fight against him much easier, getting a key after searching his corpse. However, we lost both arms against a guard. We managed to escape, but decided to quit the run early afterwards.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>Started off fine, quickly making our way through the basement. Successfully used Necromancy on a skeleton. In the prisons, Cahara joined the party, fought against a ghoul and unsuccessfully attempted Necromancy on it. In the blood pit, Cahara left the party and stole a blue vial from our inventory, and we made way into the inner hall. Exiting the blood pit, we ended up hiding from Trotur avoiding conflict and running away from battles, eventually going through the courtyard and into the entrance. There we found the Book of Fears and the girl, though we lacked the ability to free her from the cage she was in. Ended up at the starting point again, bought a potion from the merchant and headed back into the entrance, being chased by hounds. Won against the first group of hounds, but lost to the second.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>Gathered a few supplies from the starting point before heading directly to the stairway to the basement. In the basement, fought a Maneba and explored thoroughly, before falling into the flipside. Avoided the Black Witch in flipside and quickly got out. Explored the basement further, avoiding the Iron Shakespeare. Headed towards the prisons, avoiding all enemies and unlocking the cage elevator. Found the blood pit, took the elevator to the caverns, where Moonless joined the party. Talked to Pocketcat and fought Cavegnomes. Headed to the mines, where we successfully avoided the Crow Mauler but lost to a yellow mage.</p>
