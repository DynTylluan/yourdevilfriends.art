## The World

Meet Drazkise, a character for a D&D campaign based on magical girls and Super Sentai. His «superhero» outfit is inspired by the World tarot card.

Made with Procreate.

## The Star

This one is Memoru, my backup for the same campaign that doubles as Drazkise's roommate. His magical boy outfit is inspired by the Star tarot card.

Much like the previous piece, this was made with Procreate.
