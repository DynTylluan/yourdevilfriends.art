### The guy himself

I'm Bruno «devils» A., a 25 year-old artist from Portugal. He/him or they/them if you absolutely must refer to me.

I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia, so that might come up in my art or blog. I'm usually pretty coherent though.

These labels apply to me:

- [An amalgamation](https://morethanone.info/)
- NEET </3
- [Proud furry trash](/fursonas)

I use [Linux](https://endeavouros.com/) BTW.
