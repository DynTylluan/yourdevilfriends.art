### The guy himself

I'm Bruno «devils» A., a 25 year-old artist from Portugal. He/him or they/them if you absolutely must refer to me.

I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia, so that might come up in my art or blog. I'm usually pretty coherent though.

I use [Linux](https://endeavouros.com/) BTW.
