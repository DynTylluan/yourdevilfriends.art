        <p>Moving between the tombstones without reason, the leaves were yellow and falling and<br>
        I felt the wind hit my face.</p>
        <p>I don't think any of us understood,<br>
        I didn't see any child crying.</p>
        <p>Your life stolen away, with water and a hard surface.</p>
        <p>Your parents invited us,<br>
        you didn't get to start school that year.</p>
        <p>What was our last exchange?<br>
        What did you want to be when you'd grown up?<br>
        After the «see you next year»s, did you figure it out?</p>
        <p>Are you an astronaut now?<br>
        Are there cows in the milky way,<br>
        is there even a heaven to explore?</p>
        <p>Our heads were full of dreams and lice.<br>
        No one seems to remember,<br>
        and that's what hurts most of all.</p>
