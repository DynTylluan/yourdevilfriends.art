                <p>Kazuichi Hanawa started his career as a manga artist with ero-guro art, with his later works being influenced by Buddhism. In the midst of his usual themes, <em>Doing Time</em> stands out from the rest of his career because it's just so different from his other work.</p>
                <p><em>Doing Time</em> is an auto-biographical manga based on the 3 years Hanawa spent in prison. It details the daily routine of an inmate from a Japanese prison without resorting to the more violent bits.</p>
                <p>A lot of people see criminals as less than human, and this book gives the reader the chance to see them in a more sympathetic light without excusing their actions.</p>
                <p>Each chapter details a single aspect of the daily life in prison, from the food to the activities. It's an incredibly strict environment, but the author recalls himself and his inmates not feeling able to return to the world outside of it, some of them not even wanting to, as they're too used to it. It certainly made me think about the importance of routines and how the things many take for granted (like good food or leisure time) might just be what's keeping these prisoners from being driven insane.</p>
                <p>Visually, it's beautiful. Hanawa has a dark art style, almost like Ukiyo-e without color. The intense shadows give dramatic moments even more impactful.</p>
                <p>I cannot think of a single thing that honestly bothered me while reading. At most, I'll say that the art style might not be to everyone's tastes and it can be heavy on the text at times. I highly recommend it.</p>

                <p><em>No Longer Human</em> is overwhelmingly depressing, so much so that I had to take breaks from it from time to time. While I do not enjoy every aspect of it, it felt a bit too real at times, especially since it's written in first person.</p>
                <p>It details the life of a man who feels truly disconnected from others, depressed and traumatized. From his childhood described in the first chapter to the very last few pages (barring the epilogue), he describes his existence as being defined by shame, his trust in others being non-existant.</p>
                <p>The book is written well, though it's not without its problems. These mainly boil down to the honestly uncomfortable way the protagonist describes women (which might not be his honest thoughts- more on that later). There are also strange expressions used, though this is likely a result of the Portuguese translation I read.</p>
                <p>Throughout the text, I related to many aspects of the character's life, but it's impossible to fully trust his words when he describes himself or even his thoughts. Perhaps people who've experienced a deep depression can relate to this, but when your self-esteem is that low you start wishing others hated you just as much as you hate yourself. The way the protagonist describes others around him, from women in general to his own loved ones and friends, is so harsh that it feels exaggerated. Did he write these to somehow convince the reader he was a terrible person? That's up to interpretation.</p>
                <p>It's a good book, but one I can't fully recommend. If you feel mentally unstable, I'd suggest skipping it as it can further your depressive thoughts. For everyone else, only give it a read after checking a list of the sensitive topics addressed, as there are a lot.</p>
