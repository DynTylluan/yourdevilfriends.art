            <h2>Hello?</h2>
            <img src="/images/paprika.gif" class="center">
            <p>Honestly, I think «about me» pages are kinda tacky, at least nowadays. Sure, in the indie Web niche they're a lot more unique, but most people boil themselves down to gender, pronouns, species, <em>et cetera</em>. Don't get me started on Carrd pages, with the nonsensical «do not interact» lists and so on. <em>Blech!</em></p>
            <p>So yeah, I made mine semi-hidden. I follow a strict content-first philosophy- basically, I think personal websites should be valued by the art, articles and so on they contain. Miss me with those pages that have so many GIFs that they lag your browser, yo.</p>
            <h2>anyways...</h2>
            <p>Right, I haven't told you much about myself so far, at least in terms of «identity». Ah, but what is an identity? I've been trying to figure that one out for ages.</p>
            <p>Oh, names. My name is devils, though Bruno works just as well. I have an uptime of around 25 years, my operating system is EndeavourOS, and I've been online since 2007. He/they.</p>
            <p>In case you're wondering, here are the ingredients that compose this loose idea of self:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 gay demons, who are also cats, who are also other things sometimes;</li>
                <li>3 shapeless concepts;</li>
                <li>1 horrifying creature;</li>
                <li>1.5 children;</li>
                <li>other things are added if they're needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>«That tells me absolutely nothing.» you might say, which is fair. Fine, I'll make it easier for you...</p>
            <p class="yell">I am a cock-sucking faggot who really likes to disclose information in the most obtuse of manners.</p>
            <p>Hope that helps.</p>
