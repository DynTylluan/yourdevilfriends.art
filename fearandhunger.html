                <!--Preamble-->
                <h2>Preamble</h2>
                <p>Before ever playing <em>Fear and Hunger</em>, we were introduced to the series by a video essay on the first game. Initially, we thought we would refrain from playing such a difficult game- while we're not ones to get mad at video games, we also don't like losing- and yet something about it stuck with us. Before ever having had the chance to play it we were plagued with dreams where we would explore its world... Without even coming into direct contact with it, the series had quickly become a bit of an obsession.</p>
                <p>After some weeks of deliberation, we ended up buying both games on June 24th, 2023. To our surprise, the exceedingly hard and unfair nature of the game did not deter us from enjoying the experience.</p>
                <p>We decided to detail our adventures here.</p>
                <!--Fear and Hunger 2: Termina-->

                <h3>Run #1</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Date: 24/06/2023</li>
                    <li>Played as: Mercenary</li>
                    <li>Difficulty: Terror and Starvation</li>
                    <li>Additional thoughts: Got further than we thought we would, mainly by avoiding enemies</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Gathered a few supplies from the starting point before heading directly to the stairway to the basement. In the basement, fought a Maneba and explored thoroughly, before falling into the flipside. Avoided the Black Witch in flipside and quickly got out. Explored the basement further, avoiding the Iron Shakespeare. Headed towards the prisons, avoiding all enemies and unlocking the cage elevator. Found the blood pit, took the elevator to the caverns, where Moonless joined the party. Talked to Pocketcat and fought Cavegnomes. Headed to the mines, where we successfully avoided the Crow Mauler but lost to a yellow mage.</p>
