            <h1>That one Neocities user</h1>
            <section>
                <p>Where there's a large community, there's bound to be drama. This is true for both online and offline life- large groups of people are bound to have a few bad apples and people who disagree.</p>
                <p>In this post, we'd like to bring you back to the summer of 2022, specifically within the Neocities community, and go over the most bizarre drama we've seen on that site. It involves people who we're friends or acquainted with, ourselves for the briefest time, a bunch of kids for no fucking good reason, and a strange user going by <em>dreamie</em>.</p>
                <p>Now, dreamie frequently hopped from pronoun set to pronoun set- which is not bad in itself- as a way to switch goal posts and deflect criticisms by accusing other of misgendering them. As such, we have no fucking clue which pronouns they use... so, we're sticking with «they/them» since that's usually a safe bet.</p>
                <p>Besides that, the proof of a lot of these things has not been properly archived or happened in deleted Discord servers, so while you may take these accusations with a pinch of salt, please do keep in mind that what we say here would be said by most who used Neocities at the time. All we're saying is... where there's smoke, there's fire.</p>
                <p>As a final introductory note, we're white. If we're incorrect about an aspect of a certain culture, feel free to let us know so we can fix that.</p>
                <p><strong>Content warning:</strong> extremely online stupidity</p>

                <!--Who-->
                <h2 id="who">Who even is dreamie?</h2>
                <p>In short, dreamie (AKA dollie, corpse, bitty, chii, and whatever else they went by) is a pathological liar, and quite the toxic one at that.</p>
                <p>Neocities hosted plenty of their sites, their most well-known ones being strawbabie.neocities.org and lullabye.neocities.org. On Tumblr, they had multiple blogs and frequently changed their URLs. They were also on Everskies and Discord, and God knows what else.</p>
                <p>According to them they were an AMAB cherokee roma jewish intersex two-spirit trans woman and trans man (yes, at the same time... we don't know either) who has schizophrenia and other mental health issues and is part of an OSDD system. At one point they were black, but they eventually stopped claiming that (not before using a bunch of slurs that target black people though).</p>
                <p>According to reality, we have no fucking clue.</p>
                <!--Lies & drama-->
                <h2 id="drama">The many lies and dramas of dreamie</h2>
                <p>Oh boy, here we go... Here's a summarized list of their lies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Their ever-changing race, which was always anything but white;</li>
                    <li>Their family history, claiming to have family members who were murdered on a reservation;</li>
                    <li>Their skin tone, claiming to not be white-passing at all;</li>
                    <li>Being discriminated from homeless shelters based on their ethnic traits;</li>
                    <li>Not having money or access to medical help after being told to «seek help»;</li>
                    <li>... Yet still managing to live in a seven room apartment(????);</li>
                    <li>Knowing Hebrew at all, proceeding to post statuses on the Neocities homefeed in that language which were later confirmed to have been translated on Google;</li>
                    <li>And much more!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Now, is it possible that some of these things could be true in most circumstances? Yeah, sure. However, the amount of claims they made regarding <strong>everything</strong> about their minority status just did not add up.</p>
                <p>Not only that, but even if everything was somehow true, it would not excuse the way they behaved online. They consistently used these claims as a «gotcha» in arguments, tried to start discourse or drama about these topics, vagueposted about other users, encouraged others to harm themselves in quite graphic ways, played the victim... and much, much more.</p>
                <p>The dramas they involved themselves in online were innumerable, though we'll focus on the nonsense they got up to on Neocities.</p>
                <p>They first got notoriety by «calling out» a genuine pedophile and consequently ruining any chance of them getting any real-life consequences for their actions- that's a whole 'nother story in which not all parties involved are comfortable sharing the details, so we'll leave it at that. We're mainly referring to this for context.</p>
                <p>After derailing the catching of a predator by «exposing» her, it should come as no surprise to learn that they had a bit of a savior complex- suddenly, a whole lotta people were groomers and pedophiles based on... fictional ships and a GIF that was sent as a joke (of Goku's feet) among teenagers...?</p>
                <p>Yeah, okay, that was just fucking ridiculous. Even worse, it was a bit of an open secret that they were in direct contact with kids (really young too, think 12-14 years old) as someone in their 20s. This alone would be pretty creepy, but what was truly vile was the fact that they manipulated these kids into being their white knights, dragging them into drama and discourse about things kids that young should not be exposed to. It's a pretty clear example of non-sexual grooming, whether dreamie or the victims themselves realize it.</p>
                <p>They often lied about other users, and we've experienced this first-hand. It's a bit of a minor incident, but we figured we'd mention it just so you get an idea of their pattern of behavior.</p>
                <p>We said something about how they <a href="/images/article-images/what.png">watermarked someone else's <em>selfie</em></a> to put it on their site- needless to say, that crumb of criticism drove them up the wall. They blocked us, which is fair, but then proceeded to vaguepost about us (even though they stated they didn't vaguepost at all). We're all for respecting people's boundaries, but considering they had already stalked two of our friends and more people as well, we figured we'd leave a final message. Cue a shit-flinging contest:</p>
                <img src="/images/article-images/our-cameo.png" class="center" alt="Screenshot of an online argument. It reads:
                Us: Hey, @tumor. If you're gonna talk shit about us over a singular crumb of criticism, at least have the decency to @ us next time.
                ophanim: They're still making drama? The rebrandings they go through are for nothing
                77heaven: that was at ophanim, and you came onto my page
                77heaven: oh you're onlinedevil. makes fucking sense
                77heaven: oh this is about the helluva boss comment. yeah you could've just shut the fuck up
                Us: @77heaven, I didn't know ophanim liked Helluva Boss -_- Jesus Christ, do [you] talk shit about anyone who criticizes you?
                77heaven: like you guys do???? ophanim dedicated an entire diary page to whining about me
                Us: All our interactions with you were either 1) polite or 2) criticism. We're not ophanim, so don't bring them into this.
                77heaven: except for on your onlinedevil account, where you were repeatedly disgusting and hostile towards me and others. you guys are fucking clowns. go back to making out with each other and stay the fuck off of my page
                Us: «Repeatedly disgusting and hostile» AKA we poked fun of you for sending death threats to other users. Just so we're clear.">
                <p>They proceeded to claim we said they should off themselves, something we didn't do either publicly or privately, and were dead-set on convincing us and others we had done so in a manner that came a bit too close to gaslighting for our tastes. Mind you, it didn't work, though we still made sure we hadn't said nothing of the sort.</p>
                <p>These kinds of arguments could go on for a while. To be fair, dreamie was fun to poke fun of because of their over-reactions and honestly idiotic ramblings and because everyone and their grandmother was sick of their shit. Want an example? Well, here you go:</p>

                <p>They also threw a tantrum over an alterhuman webring, calling its owner (who is psychotic) sanist for no good reason. No, we are not kidding:</p>

                <!--Proof-->
                <h2 id="proof">How we know they lied</h2>
                <p>Their most egregious lies were about their race, so we'll mainly focus on that.</p>
                <p>A few anonymous users (we're fairly certain they're anonymous since this information mostly comes from lolcow.farm) did some digging, and boy howdy did they find gold. Here's how it all went down:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>After finding one of dreamie's old Tumblr blogs, users noticed it led to a DeviantArt account. In said account, various stamps were favorited, and some of those stamps were featured in the blog they had at the time (corpsetrait).</li>
                    <li>A Toyhou.se profile that used the same username as the DeviantArt account was found, and included an OC named Seth Elmas Fitzroy. The character's name and design was also featured in corpsetrait.</li>
                    <li>An older Tumblr blog (delilah-dangerous) made a post with some shop.io aesthetics, and one of them was under a collection for an OC with the exact same full name, with similar aesthetics as the character in the previously mentioned accounts. That collection was made by the user @trans-gyaru on shop.io.</li>
                    <li>That same username was used in a Tumblr sideblog, <a href="/images/article-images/trans-gyaru.jpg">in which the user said they were white</a>.</li>
                    <li>The aesthetics were posted on delilah-dangerous, meaning they're the same user as trans-gyaru. In that blog, they said they were white <a href="/images/article-images/delilah-dangerous-1.jpg">at least</a> <a href="/images/article-images/delilah-dangerous-2.png">two times</a>. They also posted a selfie.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Now, you might be wondering how a jewish cherokee roma AMAB person who was previously black and is <em>definitely not</em> white-passing at all looks like. Well...</p>
                <figure class="center">
                    <img src="/images/article-images/gay-vampire.jpg" alt="Selfie of a red-haired pale white person">
                    <figcaption>You might want to go outside to fix that snow white complexion.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>... Dude, we're tanner than that by simply going out. Where are their ethnic features, which totally got them kicked out of homeless shelters when they weren't in their seven room apartment? Who knows!</p>
                <p>Their other lies (various users being predators or racist or transphobic or whatever, us telling them to kill themselves, God knows what else) were exaggerated at best and fabricated at worst. There was never any concrete proof of anything they claimed.</p>
                <!--The now-->
                <h2 id="now">What now?</h2>
                <p>What happened to dreamie? Well, after some light digging on Discord we found a now-protected Twitter account that likely belongs to them. However, we won't mention their handle since not only do we not have confirmation that they are the same person, that account had a <em>lot</em> of triggering content and shotacon porn. So much for calling anyone that veered slightly against art censorship a predatory «proshitter», we suppose...</p>
                <p>We can laugh at how ridiculous this whole ordeal was, though it's also pretty sad to know that lots of people were genuinely hurt by them. Users on Neocities, Tumblr, etc., they were manipulated into siding with them, and the many kids who were in contact with them are probably still very hurt by that.</p>
                <p>A lesson was learned by many: don't just trust everyone on the Internet, regardless of how nice they are to you (there really should be mandatory classes on Internet safety at this point). As for dreamie, we'd say they would have learned not to lie about their entire fucking identity but honestly we highly doubt that happened.</p>
                <!--Special thanks-->
                <h2 id="thanks">Special thanks and further reading</h2>
                <p>Special thanks to our pals who had to deal with this weirdo and everyone who bullied them into leaving Neocities.</p>
                <p>If you're equally as fascinated by this shitshow as we are, here's other some stuff related to dreamie (none of them are made by us):</p>
