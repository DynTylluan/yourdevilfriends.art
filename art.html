        <p>I think art's pretty cool, don't you? On the sidebar, you can find the various galleries in this section. I hope you enjoy! <span>Also my commissions are open, info below, OK, thanks, bye.</span></p>
        <h2>Terms of use</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>My fanart can be used as icons, banners, <em>et cetera</em> as long as you give me proper credit. I would prefer you refrain from using art with original characters or commissions.</li>
            <li>Absolutely no NFTs, absolutely no AI feeding.</li>
            <li>Freebies require credit too, y'know!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Commissions</h2>
        <p>I currently only take commissions for <strong>personal use</strong>. Payment is done through PayPal in EUR, either half or fully upfront (I prefer half).</p>
        <p>Clients must be over 18 years of age.</p>
        <p>I <strong>will</strong> draw: SFW art, NSFW art (most kinks are okay, I'll let you know if I'm not comfortable drawing yours), gore</p>
        <p>I <strong>won't</strong> draw: hate art towards any demographic or person, NSFW art in medical settings, scat</p>
        <p>I currently offer digital illustrations and pixel art. Additionally, I might accept shortform comic commissions, though pricing in those instances would vary heavily on a case by case basis.</p>
        <p>Prices raise with character/background complexity and amount of characters. Minor fixes to the sketch or lineart are free, but fixes after the lineart will add to the price. All pieces include shading (specify if you don't want it). WIP screenshots are sent regularly for free.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Digital drawing (half or fullbody): 25-50€</strong><br>
            Transparent or simple backgrounds, photo backgrounds must be free to use for commercial purposes. Can include up to 3 characters.</li>
            <li><strong>Full digital illustration: 60-120€</strong><br>
            Includes a scenic background, can include up to 6 characters.</li>
            <li><strong>Pixel art: 20-40€</strong><br>
            Can include background or animation, the original size must be at most 64x64 (we can resize it for free). 1 character only. NSFW isn't available for this option.</li>
        </ul>
