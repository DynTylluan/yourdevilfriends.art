                <p>With its name translating to «Chicken Temptation» (seriously, who names these fucking things?), Knorr certainly seems to have pride in its instant noodles...</p>
                <p>... and, to be honest, they should. We already had high expectations after <a href="#knorr-cheese">trying out their cheese flavor</a>, and it turned out even better than those.</p>
                <p>The broth is mostly made of chicken stock and herbs, but it also has a bit of cayenne pepper and turmeric, giving it a very nice flavor. I'd compare the flavor to some delicious fried chicken (the quality kind, not KFC or something).</p>

                <p>We ate these expensive (more than 2€) noodles thinking they'd be at least a tiny bit similar to any other instant noodles we've ever had.</p>
                <p>That was not the case. They were almost comparable to something you'd eat at a snack bar. What the hell are we supposed to rate this thing?! Comparing them to cheap-as-hell instant noodles doesn't even feel fair.</p>
                <p>Whatever. They're good.</p>

                <p>The name of this particular packet is called «Cheese Attraction» when translated to English (no, really). However, are they <em>really</em> attractive?</p>
                <p>Well, we suppose we should start with how the noodles look when they're finished, as they're the most bizarre-looking instant food we've ever eaten. Because the seasoning powder is full of actual cheese and turmeric, its broth is <strong>neon yellow</strong>. It includes dry herbs as well, which float in the broth... <em>and</em> it smells pretty bad too, with the cheese and all. It honestly reminds us of some sort of toxic sludge.</p>
                <p>However, the cheese flavor mixed with the herbs and spices makes for quite a tasty snack. We actually really enjoyed it, and it's nice to see an uncommon ramen broth like this every once in a while.</p>

                <h3 id="koka-vegetable">Vegetable flavor by Koka: 2.5/5</h3>
                <p>Oh my lord, Koka noodles again. This time, they're even pretty bearable, almost good-<em>ish</em>, though ultimately just kind of forgettable.</p>
                <p>We like to think we've gotten better at analyzing flavors of instant noodles (such a useful skill, we know), but these? They just kind of taste like vegetable soup, albeit a bit more bland and a lot more watery, and as such is better than most Koka noodles.</p>
                <p>Boring-ass instant noodles... What's that? Why do we keep buying Koka products? They're 99 cents each packet.</p>

                <h3 id="koka-curry">Curry Flavor by Koka: 2/5</h3>
                <p>We don't really know how to describe this one... Koka noodles are notoriously cheap (even by instant ramen standards), so we weren't expecting much. Did it disappoint us? Not really. It also did not surprise us in any way.</p>
                <p>It was incredibly spicy, so much so that the spice almost overshadowed the flavor completely. That's a good thing, because the flavor itself was mediocre at best. Man, whatever... we suppose it's edible enough.</p>

                <h3 id="pg-shrimp">Shrimp Flavor by <span lang="pt">Pingo Doce</span>: 3.5/5</h3>
                <p>Since we liked their cup noodles so much, we decided to pick up another kind of noodles from <span lang="pt">Pingo Doce</span>. While not as flavorful as Beef Teriyaki, it's not bad at all. We actually enjoyed the mild flavor, despite not being fans of seafood ramen (the instant kind at least).</p>
                <p>Overall, they're slightly above average in terms of taste compared to most instant noodles seen around these parts. I'm sure the guys responsible for making instant noodles for this Portuguese supermarket chain must be really proud of themselves.</p>
                <!---->
                <h3 id="ww-chicken">Chicken Flavor by Wai Wai: 4/5</h3>
                <p>Pretty damn good! The only thing we can really complain about is that the seasoning had too much garlic (then again, we're incredibly picky with the amount of garlic in food). We liked that the spicy seasoning was separate from the regular seasoning- we're fans of spiciness, but many people aren't, so we appreciate the thought.</p>
                <p>The packet had instructions, obviously, but one of the suggestions was just straight-up deranged... it was to «munch it», which in their words means to «open pack and seasonings, mix well and eat from the pack»...? We have no idea who in their right mind would eat uncooked noodles, seasoned or not. What a strange suggestion.</p>

                <p>Eh. A bit too salty, honestly, but otherwise okay. Not good, but <em>okay</em>. What's up with the <a href="/images/article-images/racism-noodle.jpg" target="_blank">racist caricature in the packaging</a> though...?</p>

                <h3 id="nissin-demae">Demae Ramen Miso by Nissin: 3/5</h3>
                <p>We typically really like Nissin noodles, but this one wasn't really it... Too salty for us. However, there was a slightly spicy aftertaste that we enjoyed.</p>

                <p>Can <strong>anyone at all</strong> explain why these store-brand noodles fuck so hard? It's an amazing blend of sweet, salty and spicy... on store-brand noodles... what??</p>
                <p>The only complaint is that I have to go to <span lang="pt">Pingo Doce</span> and hear one of their <a href="https://youtu.be/sGBN85XLjXI" target="_blank">overly obnoxious advertisement jingles</a>.</p>
