            <h2>The fall</h2>
            <p>Moving between the tombstones without reason, the leaves were yellow and falling and<br>
            I felt the wind hit my face.</p>
            <p>I don't think any of us understood,<br>
            I didn't see any child crying.</p>
            <p>Your life stolen away, with water and a hard surface.</p>
            <p>Your parents invited us,<br>
            you didn't get to start school that year.</p>
            <p>What was our last exchange?<br>
            What did you want to be when you'd grown up?<br>
            After the «see you next year»s, did you figure it out?</p>
            <p>Are you an astronaut now?<br>
            Are there cows in the milky way,<br>
            is there even a heaven to explore?</p>
            <p>Our heads were full of dreams and lice.<br>
            No one seems to remember,<br>
            and that's what hurts most of all.</p>
