            <h2>A terrifying presence has entered the room...</h2>
            <!--Introduction-->
            <p><em>Fear and Hunger</em> is a series of dark fantasy games made in the RPGMaker engine. There are two games in the series, both solely developed by Miro Haverinen, and both are known for their unrelenting difficulty and seemingly unfair nature.</p>
            <p>However, I'd argue the games are not entirely unfair, because you're not meant to understand them fully the first few times you play them. I believe the games are much more enjoyable if you approach them as you would approach a <em>puzzle</em>- you'll learn about the mechanics as you play more and more, and chances are you'll be immersed in a deeply fascinating world as well.</p>
            <p>That's not to say it's everyone's cup of tea- far from it, in fact. Not only will the lack of even a basic tutorial drive away some players, it contains a lot of topics a lot of people can't stomach well (such as gore, graphic nudity, sexual violence, drug use, and more).</p>
            <p>If those things don't deter you, why not give it a chance?</p>
            <!--Experience-->
            <h2>Where to start?</h2>
            <p>I can admit my experience with these games has mostly been with the first one, merely because it's what introduced us to this series. However, because the second game gives you more directions and hints (although they're still vague and easy to miss), Fear and Hunger 2: Termina is usually a better starting point.</p>
            <p>It's important to note that because the first game and termina have different settings and mechanics, they will offer two different experiences, so it's worth playing both of them.</p>
            <h3>Tips for beginners</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Some enemies are not worth fighting- in fact, it's wiser to talk to or avoid some of them.</li>
                <li>Saving is a luxury and not guaranteed- if you have a way to save your game without a coin flip, strategize when you'll do so.</li>
                <li>Don't use bear traps on weak enemies, as they're hard to find.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Stuff I usually do that you might find useful</h3>
            <p>I usually check <a href="https://fearandhunger.wiki.gg/wiki/%22Fear_and_Hunger:_the_Tormentpedia%22_Wiki">the F&H wiki</a> after each run to see what I did wrong or right. Additionally, it provides strategies for getting further without spoiling the experience.</p>
            <p>Studying the maps of the game is crucial, both in and off-game. I usually try to familiarize myself with the layouts provided in the wiki, which do tell you where the items and traps are (you'll probably forget these spots in your actual playthrough if you're like me though), but the most important part is figuring out how the mazelike maps look like. The spots where the traps and items are are things that you naturally remember the more you play the games.</p>
